## Dataset
- Text data labeled with emotional categories
- Preprocessed using tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- NLTK / spaCy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Models Implemented
- Naive Bayes
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Count Vectorizer

## Evaluation
- Accuracy
- Classification Report
- Cross-validation

## Results
The model achieved satisfactory accuracy in classifying emotions from textual data, demonstrating effective feature extraction and model selection.
